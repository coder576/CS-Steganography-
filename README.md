# CS-Steganography-
# 🕵️‍♂️ Image Steganography Using Python (LSB Method)

This project demonstrates how to securely hide and retrieve secret messages inside images using the **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** technique of image steganography, implemented in **Python** using the **Pillow** library.

## 📌 Problem Statement

In a world where data privacy and secure communication are critical, this project addresses the challenge of hiding sensitive messages in plain sight. Instead of encryption that attracts attention, steganography offers a subtle way to embed secret text within images, making detection and interception more difficult.

## 💡 System Approach

### ✅ System Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow (PIL fork)
- Any standard image format (PNG, JPG) for encoding

### ✅ Required Python Library

- `Pillow` for image handling  
  Install with:

  ```bash
  pip install pillow
